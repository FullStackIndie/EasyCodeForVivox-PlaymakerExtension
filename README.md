# EasyCodeForVivox-PlaymakerExtension
This is an Extension Asset for **Vivox Voice Chat

Designed for use **Vivox Voice Chat on the Unity Asset Store and Unity Game Engine version 2019.4.28f1 because it has long term support.
The scripts should work with any 2019 version or above. You can try 2018 versions at your own risk.


This is provided with a PlayMaker Extension that only works if you have bought **PlayMaker from their website or the Unity Asset Store.
The PlayMaker version I have used is 1.9.2.f3 which is their latest update at the time of this article.

This Asset is free and posted on Github as a backward compatible version for people who have not transitioned to Unity 2021.3.
Their will be a seperate Asset on the Unity Asset Store for people using the Unity 2021.3 version
Feel free to fork, clone, or sell this asset.

** Vivox Voice Chat and PlayMaker are seperate Unity Assets in the Asset Store that must be downloaded or purchased seperately
